= RdocInfo

A simple Sinatra-based web service that generates and hosts rdocs (actually,
yardocs) for GitHub-based projects. Accepts updates from post-commit hooks and
regenerates as needed. Public service is hosted at http://rdoc.info or
http://rubydoc.info

PLEASE NOTE: future development of this service has moved to the new
rubydoc.info project. See http://github.com/lsegal/rubydoc.info for more
information!! Thanks :)

== Configuration

All configuration is done in the <tt>conf</tt> directory via environment yaml
files. Copy <tt>development.yml.example</tt> to <tt>development.yml</tt>
within that directory and alter the settings to match your local environment.

There are a couple additional steps you'll need to take to get rdoc.info working:

* Install the YARD gem -- see http://github.com/lsegal/yard
* Create a symlink from /public/rdoc to ../rdoc/default

Note that we currently use a customized version of YARD in production that
filters potentially unsafe yardoc options such as --query.

Once you've done that you should be ready to rock.

== GitHub Pages Integration

GitHub Pages support has been removed from master as it was proving to be a
bit unreliable. Check the github-pages branch if you're interested in this
stuff.

== Getting Started

  rake gems:install
  rake db:migrate
  ruby bin/run.rb
